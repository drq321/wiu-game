# MPTT Framework
## Who is Undercover? Guiding LLMs to Explore Multi-Perspective Team Tactic in the Game

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI agents but struggle with open decision-making in complex scenarios. To address this, we propose the Multi-Perspective Team Tactic (MPTT) framework, using the language logic game "Who is Undercover?" (WIU) as a testbed. MPTT enhances LLMs' language logic, multi-dimensional thinking, and self-awareness. Through alternating speaking and voting sessions and techniques like self-perspective, identity determination, self-reflection, and multi-round collaboration, LLM agents make rational decisions by strategically concealing information and building trust. Experiments show that MPTT, paired with WIU, harnesses LLMs' cognitive capabilities to simulate societal decision-making, supporting minority group communication and promoting fairness. We also introduce a word network dataset with multidimensional semantic relations for WIU and other language-intensive tasks. Human-in-the-loop experiments further reveal LLMs' ability to learn and align with human behavior, showcasing their potential in societal decision-making.

**Improvement with MPTT.** MPTT is significantly improved in 3 areas. Include (a) Hidden private words, (b) Broader descriptive content, and (c) More accurate trust relationships.

We explore advanced tactics used by AI agents in the WIU game and their impact on game dynamics. Conscious Guess: Like humans, AI agents attempt to infer others' difference and adjusting strategies. Vote for the Teammate: AI undercovers may strategically vote against a fellow undercover with more exposure, creating confusion and gaining civilian trust. While this tactic can mislead opponents, it also increases the challenge for the AI team, requiring strong acumen and adaptability.
